    "- Groups will judged on how much money their model makes. You will use your model on the testing dataset by making predictions on it and testing them. Assume that each loan is 1000 dollars and the interest rate is 10 percent. That means for every loan you issue that is successfully repaid, you will earn 100 dollars and for every loan you issue that defaults, you will lose 1000 dollars.\n",
